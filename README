Description
============================================================================

This module provides the ability to create and manage Text To Speech entries
within FreePBX.  These entries can be used many different ways, of which the
top ones are: As custom system recordings created in the asterisk dir
"sounds/texttospeech/", and as interim destinations where the text will be
spoken and then the user forwarded on to another destination or returned to
an IVR.

The text itself can be statically configured, or fetched from several
different sources such as a text file, a shell command, or a URL.  It can be
configured to synthesize the text once (static mode), or fetch the text
and re-synthesize each time the text-to-speech entry is used (dynamic mode).

The text can be synthesized using one of several different engines, including
Google TTS, Microsoft TTS, Cepstral SWIFT, eSpeak, FLite, and Text2Wave.  

For those of you who have the newer versions of Cepstral SWIFT that does not
include the save-to-file license by default, a dynamic option is provided for
the Cepstral SWIFT engine which will then utilize the Asterisk app_swift
application each time the text-to-speech entry is used.

Using Microsoft Translation Text-To-Speech Engine
============================================================================

The Microsoft Translation engine takes advantage of Microsoft's Translation
API.  To gain access to this API, you must first subscribe to the Translation
API service through Microsoft's Azure Marketplace.  They do provide a free
subscription which includes up to 2 million characters a month.

If you don't already have a subscription or client ID/secret, please follow
the steps below.  You can find out more detailed information by visting:
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh454950.aspx


Step 1
------

Subscribe to the Microsoft Translator API on Azure Marketplace.

Go to this URL:
	https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/1899a118-d202-492c-aa16-ba21c33c06cb

You will then need to sign-in using your Microsoft Live account, or
register a new one.

Once you've chosen a subscription (such as the 2,000,000 chars/month, you
can move on to step 2.


Step 2
------

You now need to create an application registeration to make use of the
Microsoft Translator API subscription.

Go to this URL and click on the green 'REGISTER' button:
	https://datamarket.azure.com/developer/applications/

Fill out the form as follows:

	Client ID
		Pick a unique ID here, example: "<your name>_pbx_mstts"

	Name
		Choose any name, example: "<your name> MS-TTS Asterisk App"

	Client Secret
		You can use the randomized one already filled in, or
		create your own

	Redirect URI
		This isn't used for the translator API, however the Azure site
		requires it to be filled in.  I suggest using a value such as
		"http://localhost/mstts_oauth_response.aspx"

Before you hit the 'CREATE' button, you need to write down and save
the Client ID and the Client Secret.  These are the two values
you will need to provide in the text-to-speech configuration.
